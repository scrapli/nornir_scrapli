nornir_scrapli
==============

nornir_scrapli -- [scrapli](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli)'s and 
[scrapli_netconf](https://github.com/scrapli/scrapli_netconf)'s plugin for nornir!

Feel free to join the very awesome networktocode slack workspace [here](https://networktocode.slack.com/), where you
 will find a `scrapli` channel where you can discuss anything about scrapli, as well as tons of other channels covering
  all sorts of network/network-automation topics!

# Quick Start Guide

## Installation

In most cases installation via pip is the simplest and best way to install nornir_scrapli.

```
pip install nornir-scrapli
```


## A Simple Example

Example config file:

```yaml
---
inventory:
  plugin: YAMLInventory
  options:
    host_file: "nornir_data/hosts.yaml"
    group_file: "nornir_data/groups.yaml"
    defaults_file: "nornir_data/defaults.yaml"
```

Example inventory file (host/group/default, see "real" Nornir docs for lots more info!) -- please notice that there
 is a `scrapli` and a `scrapli_netconf` connection type here!:
```yaml
---
iosxe-1:
  hostname: 172.18.0.11
  connection_options:
    scrapli:
      platform: cisco_iosxe
      port: 22
      extras:
        ssh_config_file: True
        auth_strict_key: False
    scrapli_netconf:
      port: 830
      extras:
        ssh_config_file: True
        auth_strict_key: False
```

```python
from nornir import InitNornir
from nornir_scrapli.tasks import (
    get_prompt,
    send_command,
    send_configs
)

nr = InitNornir(config_file="nornir_data/config.yaml")

prompt_results = nr.run(task=get_prompt)
command_results = nr.run(task=send_command, command="show version")
config_results = nr.run(
    task=send_configs,
    configs=["interface loopback123", "description nornir_scrapli was here"],
)

print("get_prompt result:")
print(prompt_results["iosxe-1"].result)
print("send_command result:")
print(prompt_results["iosxe-1"].result)
print("send_configs result:")
print(config_results["iosxe-1"].result)
```

```
$ python my_scrapli_script.py
get_prompt result:
3560CX#
send_command result:
Cisco IOS Software, C3560CX Software (C3560CX-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.2(4)E7, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)
<SNIP>
send_configs result:


```

Netconf tasks are imported from the same package and in the same fashion as the "core" `scrapli` tasks:

```python
from nornir_scrapli.tasks import (
    netconf_lock,
    netconf_unlock,
    netconf_edit_config,
    netconf_get,
    netconf_get_config,
    netconf_rpc
)
```

And are executed in the same fashion as well:

```python
config = """<config>
    <interfaces xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces">
        <interface>
            <name>GigabitEthernet1</name>
            <description>scrapli was here!</description>
        </interface>
    </interfaces>
</config>"""
result = nr.run(task=netconf_edit_config, config=config)
print(result['iosxe1'][0].result)
print(result['iosxe1'][0].scrapli_response.xml_result)
```

When using the `scrapli-netconf` tasks the result object `result` will be the string of the returned data from the
 device. As with all other `nornir-scrapli` results, the `scrapli_response` object will be assigned to the `Result
 ` object and will contain all of the "normal" `scrapli` response object data (or `scrapli-netconf` response data
 ), such as the `elapsed_time`, `raw_result`, `xml_result`, etc. -- you can see this in the above example!


## Supported Platforms

nornir_scrapli supports the "core" scrapli drivers, the GenericDriver (for use with linux hosts generally speaking
), and the [scrapli_community](https://github.com/scrapli/scrapli_community) platforms as well! See
[scrapli core docs](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli#supported-platforms) and the
[scrapli community docs](https://github.com/scrapli/scrapli_community#supported-platforms) for more info. The `platform
` argument in the inventory data should use the "normal" NAPALM style platform names, `generic`, or the name of the
 scrapli_community platform (i.e. `huawei_vrp`)). 

Example platform values (for inventory data):

```
platform: cisco_iosxe
platform: cisco_iosxr
platform: cisco_nxos
platform: arista_eos
platform: juniper_junos
platform: generic
platform: huawei_vrp
```

# General Information

Nornir has historically contained it's plugins within the actual Nornir codebase itself, this however has changed! As
 of mid September 2020, Nornir 3.0.0 has been officially released -- this move to the 3.x.x version now expects
  plugins to be external to the code base. If you are looking for pre 3.x.x support, please use the `2020.09.01
  ` version.

If you have used Nornir before (pre 3.x.x), this package should be very similar to what you already know. Since the
 plugins used to live in Nornir you could simply import them from the appropriate package as such:
 
```python
from nornir.plugins.tasks.networking import netconf_get_config
```

With nornir_scrapli you simply install this package along side "regular" Nornir, and import the tasks from
 nornir_scrapli directly:
 
```python
from nornir_scrapli.tasks import send_command
```

As soon as a nornir_scrapli task is imported, it (`nornir_scrapli`) will register as a connection, and things should
 work as normal from there!

The last important difference with nornir_scrapli is that in addition to the "normal" data in the Nornir Result
 object, nornir_scrapli also assigns the scrapli `Response` object (or list of `Response` objects) to the
  `scrapli_response` attribute. This means that you can access all of the "normal" scrapli response data from this
   object -- including things like `elapsed_time` and `textfsm_parse_output`:

```python
>>> some_nornir_result["sea-ios-1"].scrapli_response.elapsed_time
0.039469
>>> some_nornir_result["sea-ios-1"].scrapli_response.textfsm_parse_output()
[[some structured data back from the device!]]
``` 

If you would like to continue using `print_result` like "normal" in nornir, but would like to see structured data (if
 available) in the `print_result` output, you can use the nornir_scrapli `print_structured_result` function. This
  function can be imported from the scrapli functions module:
  
```python
from nornir_scrapli.functions import print_structured_result
```

This function acts pretty much exactly like the "normal" print result function, but will of course try to print the
 structured result. By default this will try to use textfsm to parse results, but it is of course configurable via
  the `parser` keyword argument. As scrapli will return an empty data structure if parsing fails, this may cause
   tasks to look like they are getting skipped in the output (nornir's print result function does not print empty
    lists), if you would like to fall back to printing the unparsed output you can do so by setting the
     `fail_to_string` keyword argument to `True` as follows:
     
```python
print_structured_result(my_agg_result, parser="genie", fail_to_string=True)
```


# Available Tasks

All tasks presented here are methods that live in `scrapli` or `scrapli_netconf` -- these tasks are simply "wrapped
" in such a way that they may be used within the constructs of `nornir`! The links below link back to the `scrapli
` or `scrapli_netconf` docs for the given method -- in all (or very nearly all?) cases, the same arguments that the
 underlying library supports will be exposed to `nornir`!
